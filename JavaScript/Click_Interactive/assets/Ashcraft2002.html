    <h2> General Math Anxiety</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Math anxiety</strong> is commonly defined as a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes
             with math performance.</li>
        <li> Highly math anxious individuals avoid math. They take fewer elective math courses than people with low math 
            anxiety. And when they take math, they receive lower grades.</li>
        <li> math anxiety is only weekly related to overall intelligence.</li>
        <li>highly math-anxious individuals end up with lower math competence and achievement.</li>
        <li>individuals with high levels of math anxiety do not have a global deficit in math competence, and they can perform 
            as well as their peers on whole-number arithmetic problems.</li>
        <li> U.S. cultutre abounds with attitudes that forster math anxiety: Math is thought to be inherently difficult (as Barbie dolls 
            used to say "Math class is hard"), aptitude is considered far more important than effort, and being good at math is 
            considered relatively unimportant, or even optional.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Specific consequences of Math Anxiety </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>knowing that 15 - 8 = 7 ought to be as basic as knowing how to spell "cat".</li>
        <li>People with math anxiety tend to avoid college majors and career paths that depend heavily on math or quantitatie skills.</li>
        <li>As <emph>conventional wisdom</emph> suggests, math anxiety is somewhat higher among women than men.</li>
        <li>The gender diefference is rather small, may be particularly apparaent in highly selected groups and may be partly attributable to a greater willingness on the part
            of women to disclose personal attitudes.
        </li>
        <li>when we recruited participants for research on math anxiety, we found fewer men than women at high anxiety levels, but just the revers at low levels.</li>
        <li>individuals who are high in math anxiety also tend to score high on other anxiety tests.</li>
        <li>Faust found psychological evidence of increasing reactivity (e.g., changes in heart rate) when a highly math-anxious group performed math tasks of increasing difficulty.
            When the same participants performed an increasingly difficult verbal task, there was hardly any increase in their reactivity and participants with low math anxiety showed
            virtually no increase in either task.
        </li>
        <li>They are exposed to less math in school and apparently learn less of what they are exposed to; as a result, they show lower achievement as measured by standardized tests.</li>
        <li>If the relationship between anxiety and competence holds for all levels of math difficulty, then variations in competence will contaminate any attempt to examine
            math performance at different levels of math anxiety.
        </li>
        <li>One [way] is to test additional samples of participants on untimed pencil-and-paper versions of math problems studied in the lab.</li>
        <li>we found no anxiety effects on whole-number arithmetic problems with participants were tested using a pencil-and-paper format. But when participants were tested on-line (i.e.,
            when they were timed as they solved the problems mentally under time pressure in the lab), there were substantial anxiety effects on the same problems.
        </li>
        <li>there were no math-anxiety effects whatsoever on the first-half of the test, which measured performance on whole-number arithmetic problems.</li>
        <li>Anxiety effects were apparent only on the second half of the test, which introduced mixed fractions, percentages, equations with unknowns, and factoring.</li>
        <li>When the anxiety was relieved, a truer picture of their competence emerged.</li>
        <li>math anxiety has only minimal effects on performance with single digit addition and multiplication.</li>
        <li>decision making process sensitive to "number sense" - when making true/false judgments, highly math-anxious individuals made more errors as the problems became increasingly implausible 
            (e.g., 9 + 7 = 39), whereas low-anxiety participants made fewer errors on such problems.</li>
        <li>problems with larger numbers showed two substantial math-anxiety effects.</li>
        <li>participants at high levels of anxiety routinely responded rapidly to these problems, sometimes as rapidly as participants with low anxiety, but only by sacrificing considerable accuracy.</li>
        <li>By speeding through problems, highly anxious individuals minimized their time and involvement in the lab task, much as they probably did in math class. Such avoidance came at a price,
            however - a sharp increase in errors.
        </li>
        <li>the time disadvantage for carry versus no-carry problems was three times larger for participants with high anxiety (753 ms) than for those with low anxiety (253 ms), even aside from the
            difference in accuracy between the two groups.
        </li>
        <li>we proposed that the effects of math anxiety are tied to those cognitive operations that rely on the resources of working memory.</li>
        <li>general anxiety is hypothesized to disrupt ongoing working memory processes because anxious individuals devote attention to their intrusive throughts and worries, rather than the tast at hand.</li>
        <li>Math anxiety lowers math performance because paying attention to these intrusive thoughts acts like a secondary task, distracting attention for the math task,</li>
        <li>routine arithmetic processes like retrieval of simple facts require little in the way of working memory processing, and therefore show only minimal effects of math anxiety./li>
        <li>problems involving carrying, borrowing, and keeping track in a sequence of operations (e.g., long division) do rely on working memory, and so should show considerable math anxiety effects.</li>
        <li>note how difficult it will be, when investigating high level math topics. to distinguish clearly between the effects of high math anxiety and low math competence.</li>
        <li>no thorough empirical work on the origins of causes of math anxiety.</li>
        <li>from teachers who convey a high demand for correctness but provide little cognitive or motivation support during lessons.</li>
        <li>students with such teachers may feel "vulnerable to public displays of incompetence".</li>
        <li>It may be that intrusive thoughts and worry per se are not the problem, but insteat that math-anxious individuals fail to inhibit their attention to those distractions.</li>
        <li>The neural activity that characterizes math anxiety should bear similarities to the activity associated with other negative affective or phobic states.</li>
