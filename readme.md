# Hi, Hello there:

This is my first git repository. I am using this to store my learnings about
*websites*: **HTML5, CSS3** and **JavaScript**.

> I am very new to both git and web-dev, so please go easy on me!

## Plans for this git:
1. Build a personal website:
   - [ ] use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to make webpages
   - [ ] buy a domain name
   - [ ] host the website
2. Learn how to properly build websites
  - [ ] create a template that I can use in the future
  - [ ] try to incorporate other things such as Python3, etc.

### More details coming soon!
